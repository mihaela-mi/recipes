Ingredients:
 - 3 large free-range eggs
 - 115 g plain flour
 - 1 heaped teaspoon baking powder
 - 140 ml milk

Directions:
  1. First separate the eggs, putting the whites into one bowl and the yolks into another.
  2. Add the flour, baking powder and milk to the yolks and mix to a smooth thick batter.
  3. Whisk the whites with 1 pinch of sea salt until they form stiff peaks, then fold into the batter – it is now ready to use.
  4. Heat a non-stick pan over a medium heat, pour some of the batter into the pan and cook for a couple of minutes, or until it starts to look golden and firm.
  5. At this point sprinkle your chosen flavouring (see below) onto the uncooked side before loosening with a spatula and flipping the pancake over. Continue frying until both sides are golden.
  6. You can make these pancakes large or small, depending on what you prefer. Serve them with a drizzle of maple syrup, or even with some butter or crème fraîche. If you choose to sprinkle with a flavouring, try one of these... fresh corn from the cob, crispy bacon or pancetta, blueberries, banana, stewed apple, grated chocolate – anything else you can imagine...
